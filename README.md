# bCubed - The Block-Based Boilerplate Theme

## Typgraphy
### Families
- Integrates system font stacks as provided by [Modern Font Stacks for WP](https://github.com/LittleBigThing/Modern-Font-Stacks-for-WP), which in turn is based upon [Modern Font Stacks](https://github.com/system-fonts/modern-font-stacks)

### Sizing
- Font size naming convention based on the principles established by [Rich Tabor](https://richtabor.com/standardizing-theme-json-font-sizes/). I added 'medium' too because I wanted an extra size option for 'lede' text.
- Fluid font scaling provided by Utopia Fluid Type Calculator - [21px @ 360w to 24px @ 1280w](https://utopia.fyi/type/calculator/?c=360,21,1.2,1280,24,1.25,5,2,&s=0.75|0.5|0.25,1.5|2|3|4|6|8,s-l|4xs-xs|xs-m&g=s,l,xl,12)

## Spacing and Layout
- Fluid whitespace rhythm provided by Utopia Fluid Space Calculator - [21px @ 360w to 24px @ 1280px](https://utopia.fyi/space/calculator/?c=360,21,1.2,1280,24,1.25,5,2,&s=0.75|0.5|0.25|0,1.5|2|3|4|6|8,s-l|4xs-xs|xs-m&g=s,l,xl,12)

## Colourscheme
- TODO: Base colours need systematising as currently they are a bit random!
- TODO: Add dark mode styles override
- Colour naming convention based on the principles established by [Rich Tabor](https://richtabor.com/standardizing-theme-json-colors/).
