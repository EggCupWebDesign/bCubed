# bCubed - The Block-Based Boilerplate Theme

## Styling
### Font Sizing
- Font size naming convention based on the principles established by [Rich Tabor](https://richtabor.com/standardizing-theme-json-font-sizes/). I added 'medium' too because I wanted an extra size option for 'lede' text.
- Fluid font scaling provided by Utopia Fluid Type Calculator - [20px @ 320w to 24px @ 1280w](https://utopia.fyi/type/calculator/?c=320,20,1.2,1280,24,1.333,5,2,&s=0.75%7C0.5%7C0.25,1.5%7C2%7C3%7C4%7C6,s-l)

### Spacing and Layout
- Fluid whitespace rhythm provided by Utopia Fluid Space Calculator - [20px @ 320w to 24px @ 1280px](https://utopia.fyi/space/calculator/?c=320,20,1.2,1280,24,1.25,5,2,&s=0.75%7C0.5%7C0.25,1.5%7C2%7C3%7C4%7C6,s-l)

### Colourscheme
- TODO: Base colours need systematising as currently they are a bit random!
- TODO: Add dark mode styles override
- Colour naming convention based on the principles established by [Rich Tabor](https://richtabor.com/standardizing-theme-json-colors/).
